# Pixel_Art_Maker
Pixed Art Maker project from Udacity Nanodegree Intro to Programming.

Projects focus was to define variables by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. 
Such as the following: the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. 
Also, added event listeners to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be set by the user.

Once the cells are filled by users input it can be submitted at table will be cleared.
